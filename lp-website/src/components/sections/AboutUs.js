            <p>
                We are LaunchPad – a community of students dedicated to learning, building, and growing together.
                We provide a one-on-one, semester-long mentorship program to help first-year students hit the ground running. 
                We pair each incoming student with a talented upperclassman who will introduce them to the CS/DS community
                 at Purdue and guide them in creating a technical project of their choosing. 
                 Throughout the semester, we host events to foster a sense of community and to build technical skills. 
                 Our goal is to ensure that every incoming student is equipped with the knowledge and connections they’ll need 
                 to get the most out of their time at Purdue.
